Sure! To create a simple GitHub Actions workflow in the `.github/workflow/simple-test.yml` file, you can follow these steps:
1. **Create the Directory and File**: Make sure you have a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository. Inside that directory, create a file named `simple-test.yml`.
2. **Define the Workflow**: Open the `simple-test.yml` file and start by defining the name of your workflow and the trigger event. For example, you can trigger the workflow on every push to the main branch.
```yamlname: Simple Test Workflow
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
3. **Set Up Jobs**: Next, define the jobs that will run as part of this workflow. For a simple test, you can create a job that runs on the latest version of Ubuntu and executes some basic commands.
```yamljobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run a simple command
        run: echo "Hello, World!"
```4. **Complete the Workflow**: Combine all the parts together to complete your `simple-test.yml` file:
```yamlname: Simple Test Workflow
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run a simple command
        run: echo "Hello, World!"
```
5. **Commit and Push**: Save the file, commit your changes, and push them to your repository. GitHub Actions will automatically detect the new workflow and run it on the next push to the main branch.yaml
name: Simple Test Workflow  
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run a simple command
        run: echo "Hello, World!"
```yamlyaml
name: Simple Test Workflow
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run a simple command
        run: echo "Hello, World!"
```yamlyaml
